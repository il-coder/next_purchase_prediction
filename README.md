# Predict Next Purchase Day Range of the Customers

This project provides the facility to Predict the next purchase day range of the customers for a local store of UK. The model takes RFM value, and mean & standard deviation of purchase dates of past data and on the basis of this data, it predicts the range within which customer will make the next purchase.

## Applications : 
1. Build strategies on top of this analysis. 
2. Send targeted notifications to the customers
3. Manage inventory based on the predicted demand

## Algorithm : 
In this project, several algorithms were tried like Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, etc. Out of the tested algorithms, Random Forest algorithm produced the most stable result and accuracy. Therefore, this model uses RandomForestClassifier algorithm for the prediction.

## Steps to execute :
1. Install the jupyter notebook
2. Open the code file in the jupyter notebook
3. Load the required dataset
4. Run the code one by one
